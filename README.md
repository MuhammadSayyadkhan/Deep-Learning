# Deep Learning - README

This document provides a simple overview of **Deep Learning**, covering the main architectures:
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Transfer Learning**
- **Sequence Learning (RNN, LSTM, GRU)**

## 1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
ANN is the foundation of deep learning, inspired by the way neurons work in the human brain.

### Key Concepts
- **Perceptron**: Basic unit (like a single neuron) that takes inputs, applies weights, sums them, and passes the result through an activation function.
- **Layers**:
  - **Input Layer**: Takes in the data.
  - **Hidden Layers**: Process the data and extract patterns.
  - **Output Layer**: Produces the final result.
- **Activation Functions**: Add non-linearity to help the model learn complex patterns.
  - Examples: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh.
- **Loss Functions**: Measure how wrong the predictions are.
  - Examples: Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy.
- **Optimization**: Adjusts weights to reduce loss.
  - Example: Gradient Descent, Adam, RMSProp.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
CNNs are specialized for images and visual data. They use filters to detect features like edges, textures, and shapes.

### Key Concepts
- **Convolution Layer**: Uses filters (kernels) to extract features from the image.
- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the size of feature maps (downsampling), making the network faster and reducing overfitting.
- **Flattening**: Converts 2D feature maps into 1D for fully connected layers.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: Combines features and makes final predictions.
- **Applications**: Image classification, object detection, face recognition, medical imaging.

## 3. Transfer Learning
Transfer learning allows us to use models trained on large datasets and adapt them to new problems.

### Key Concepts
- **Pre-trained Models**: Models like VGG, ResNet, Inception trained on ImageNet.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using pre-trained model layers to extract useful features.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Retraining some layers with your own dataset for better performance.
- **Applications**: Helpful when your dataset is small or training from scratch is expensive.

## 4. Sequence Learning
Sequence models handle data that comes in order (time, text, speech, etc.).

### Types
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**:
  - Remembers past information.
  - Good for short sequences, but struggles with long-term memory (vanishing gradient problem).

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
  - Improved RNN with gates (input, forget, output).
  - Captures long-term dependencies.
  - Widely used in text and speech tasks.

- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**:
  - Similar to LSTM but simpler (only update & reset gates).
  - Faster to train while still effective for long sequences.

### Applications
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Speech Recognition
- Machine Translation
- Sentiment Analysis
- Time-Series Prediction
